## Hi there, I am Su ðŸ‘‹

I am currently an [Engineering Lead](https://nimblehq.co/compass/team/roles/engineering-lead/) at [Nimble](https://nimblehq.co), and I am still a software engineer at heart.

I am passionate about leading and helping people around me grow, achieve their goals, and positively impact the business.

### Team Values

I value excellent **excellent ownership**, **transparency**, and **empathy**. I believe these values are the key to building a strong team and ensuring the team can deliver the best products.

### Work Schedule and Location

I am based in [Da Nang, Vietnam](https://www.google.com/search?q=Danang,+Vietnam) (GMT+7). And you can find me working from [cirCO Da Nang City Centre](https://www.google.com/maps?q=cirCO+Da+Nang+City+Centre,+17+Quang+Trung+Street,+Hai+Chau+1+Ward,+Hai+Chau+District,+Da+Nang+City,+Vietnam).

Wednesdays and Fridays are my meeting-free days to ensure focused and productive work.

While I occasionally work weekends out of personal interest, I donâ€™t expect this from team members.

### Communication Preferences

I prefer to communicate via `In-person`, `Slack`, `Google Meet`, or `Email`.

If you need a quick response, I suggest you do it **in person** if you are in the same office as me. Otherwise, `Slack Huddle` is another option.

#### Coffee Chats

I believe in the power of informal conversations! Feel free to [schedule a coffee chat](https://cal.com/suvanho/cc) with me to discuss anything.

### Feedback Philosophy

I am definitely not perfect and could be better, so I always welcome feedback from everyone. This is a way for me to learn and improve.

Please provide me feedback in private in any format and specifically indicate it is feedback.
