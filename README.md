## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Su, and I am currently an [Engineering Lead](https://nimblehq.co/compass/team/roles/engineering-lead/) at [Nimble](https://nimblehq.co).

### Values

I moved into the management/leadership role to help people around me grow, achieve their goals, and positively impact the company.

Thus, I value **excellent ownership**, **transparency**, and **empathy**. I believe these values are the key to building a strong team and ensuring that the team can deliver the best products.

### Work Patterns

- I live and work in [Da Nang, Vietnam](https://www.google.com/search?q=Danang,+Vietnam&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#eim=CAEQCxoRMTYuMDYzNzY4NDc1NjE1NTIiEjEwOC4xOTkwMjU4NzAwNDY5OA) which is `GMT+7` time zone.
- I work from the office on weekdays, so you can find me in person [at the office](https://www.google.com/maps?q=cirCO,+Bay+Capital+Building,+17+Quang+Trung+Street,+Hai+Chau+1+Ward,+Hai+Chau+District,+Da+Nang+City,+Vietnam) or on `Slack` during the day.
- Wednesdays and Fridays are my focus days. I usually don't have meetings these days to focus on my work.
- Sometimes, I work weekends to satisfy my curiosity for knowledge, but I never expect anyone else to work on weekends.

### Communications

- I prefer to communicate via `In-person`, `Slack`, `Google Meet`, or `Email`. So feel free to pick one that you feel comfortable with.
- If you need a quick response, I suggest you do it `in person` if you are in the same office as me. Otherwise, `Slack Huddle` is another option.
- I am always open to having Coffee Chats to discuss anything, so feel free to [book a time with me](https://cal.com/suvanho/cc).

### Feedback

- I could be better, so I always welcome feedback from everyone. This is a way for me to learn and improve.
- Please provide me feedback in private in any format and specifically indicate it is feedback.
